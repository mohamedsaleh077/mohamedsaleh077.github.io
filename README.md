# yep this is my portoflio!
I have made this thing from A-Q (since I imported some ready-to-use CSS styles from: https://github.com/YoshiMannaert/95CSS) also used JQuery.

aslo, since I am insane, I have installed windows ME on Virtual Machine to get a screenshot of the real system, I installed a 256-bit color driver then with my color picker and code code code code, also the audio file and the images, all from the same machine, how? NOT VIRTUALBOX GUEST ADDITIONALS! I just made my own php server and used it to upload files from the virtual machine, yes this is insanity and I love that!, I will leave the php server here.

### How to use the file sharing server?
you basicly need to install PHP on your machine, then run this command in the file-share directory:
```
~$ php -S 192.168.1.7:8080 -c thing.ini
```
dont forget to check what is your actual IP or use localhost, whatever do it by yourself.

### Why not docker?
docker was angery when he found VirtualBox is running a windows ME machine so, الجيش قالك اتصرف!

### technologies
- HTML.
- CSS.
- Java script.
- JQuery.
- PHP (file sharing server to get resources from thw virtual machine).
